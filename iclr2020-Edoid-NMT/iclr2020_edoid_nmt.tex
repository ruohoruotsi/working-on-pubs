\section{Introduction}

% How language inequality came about
Many of the over 500 languages are spoken in Nigeria today have relinquished their previous prestige and purpose in modern society to English and Nigerian Pidgin, notably amongst the younger generations. Unlike numerous East and South Asian societies, which preserved the socio-linguistic status of their indigenous languages, for centuries under colonial rule, Nigerian communities with primarily oral traditions have been the most susceptible to language endangerment \citep{rolle2013phonetics}.

% How language inequality affects people and indigenous language research
For tens of millions of speakers, language inequalities manifest themselves as unequal access to information, communications, health care, security along with attenuated participation in political and civic life. These inequities are further exacerbated in a technological age, where only the most highly resourced (i.e. colonial) languages become the milieu for economic advancement \citep{odojelanguage, awobuluyi201626}. Finally, there have been practical and technical challenges in language technology for indigenous languages like orthographic standardizations and consistent diacritic representation (Unicode) in electronic media and across device types. 

% How can NMT help?
For almost-extinct languages, machine translation offers hope for language documentation and preservation. For speakers of minority Nigerian languages, it can facilitate good governance, national development and offers a path for technological, economic, social and political participation and empowerment to those with unequal access \citep{odoje201612, odojelanguage}. Using the new JW300 public dataset, we trained and evaluated baseline translation models for four of the widely spoken Edoid languages: \d{\`E}d{\'o}, \d{\`E}s{\'a}n, Urhobo and Isoko. 

% based on economic status, demography, location and language

%From a research vantage, these languages have been labelled ``low resource" due to the scarcity of academic research, online-datasets, funding and interest, due to perceptions about the prestige and utility of these languages in contemporary African life  
% Among other factors, the scarcity of highly esteemed works of literary scholarship has worked to devalue indigenous languages, making them susceptible to being replaced by other languages of power and status \citep{awobuluyi201626}. 

\subsection{Languages}
Belonging to the Volta-Niger family, and spoken by some 5 million people, the Edoid languages of Southern Nigeria (Edo and Delta State) comprise over two dozen so-called ``minority" languages. The term \emph{Edoid} stems from \d{\`E}d{\'o}, the most broadly spoken member langauge and the language of the famed Kingdom of Benin. \d{\`E}d{\'o}, \d{\`E}s{\'a}n are members of the North-Central branch while Urhobo and Isoko belong to the South-Western family \citep{wikiedoid}.

Edoid langauges are all tonal in nature, featuring multiple rising, falling and gliding tones for grammatical and lexical, syntacticpurposes toneach with a variety of dialects
Esan  is an analytic language  with very little  morphology, and maintains a  canonical SVO word order.

We contrast the performance of a baseline Transformer model across the four languages under study, examining the effect of word-level versus subword-level tokenization.

Kurdish is an Indo-European language mainly spoken in central and eastern Turkey, northern Iraq andSyria, and western Iran. It is a less-resourced language (Salavati and Ahmadi, 2018), in other words,a language for which general-purpose grammars and raw internet-based corpora are the main existingresources. The language is spoken in five main dialects, namely, Kurmanji (aka Northern Kurdish),Sorani (aka Central Kurdish), Southern Kurdish, Zazaki and Gorani (Haig and Ã–pengin, 2014).Creatinglexicaldatabasesandtextcorporaareessentialtasksinnaturallanguageprocessing(NLP)de-velopment. Text corpora are knowledge repositories which provide semantic descriptions of words. TheKurdish language lacks diverse corpora in both raw and annotated forms (Esmaili et al., 2013; Hassani,2018). According to the literature, there is no domain-specific corpus for Kurdish

While there has been recent interest in NMT for African languages, in Nigeria there has been a bit of literature on Rule-based, phrase-based and Statistical machine translation. This is the first work known to the authors done in any of the Edoid langauges specifically for machine translation.


\section{Methodology}
\label{methods}

\subsection{Dataset}
The recently released JW300 dataset is a large-scale, parallel corpus for Machine Translation (MT) comprising more than three hundred languages of which 101 are African \citep{agic-vulic-2019-jw300}. English-\{\d{\`E}d{\'o}, \d{\`E}s{\'a}n, Urhobo, Isoko\} token pairs cardinality is itemized in Table~\ref{results}.  \{10200, 2000, 200, 4000\} respectively. JW300 text is drawn from a number of online blogs, news and contemporary religious magazines by Jehovah's Witnesses (JW).
\subsection{Models}

We used the JoeyNMT framework to train the Transformer. We built all models with the Python 3 implementation of \texttt{JoeyNMT}, an open-source toolkit created by the Klein et al. \citep{opennmt}. Our training hardware configuration was a standard AWS EC2 p2.xlarge instance with a NVIDIA K80 GPU, 4 vCPUs and 61GB RAM. Training the various models took place over the course of a few days.

\subsection{Qualitative}

% Dad's view on the concepts 
Unsuprisingly, for Urhobo and Isoko which are much better resourced, the BLEU scores are generally correlated with the translation quality when reviewed by L1 speakers. For example, for Urhobo this translation captures much o

Second level headings are in small caps,
flush left and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.

\section{Future Work and Conclusions}
Fertile avenues for future work include acquiring more data, hyper-parameter optimization and experiments with Backtranslation, different tokenization approaches as well as specific consideration of linguistic knowledge. For example, the analytic nature of Edoid languages and low morpheme-per-word ratio might inform a novel tokenization approach.

 The objective of this paper was to report preliminary efforts to assist translators and the lay-person alike, working in Edoid languages. We hope to bootstrap the development and sustenance of scholarly and literary traditions, beyond religious texts. By making our models and code broadly accessible as open-source projects, we hope to energize academic and industry interest broader language technology for socio-linguistic and economic empowerment.`
 
% Thee include social justice by addressing an aspect of technological language inequality, language perservation and by establishing baselines and from which to build on. Given the comparatively low (Oladele Awobuluyi) litearay traditions but the very strong oral traditions, foundational language technologies based on good clean text, like language and translation models are just the start, but very important precusor to speech interfaces. Imagine a world in which a culture rooted in a strong oral tradition can make use of Speech-to-Speech interfaces, speaking and being spoken to idiomatically. This is where the future of African langauge technology lies and mahcine translation and good clean datasets are the core.
