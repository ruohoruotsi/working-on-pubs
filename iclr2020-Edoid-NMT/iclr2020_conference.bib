    abstract = {Viable cross-lingual transfer critically depends on the availability of parallel texts. Shortage of such resources imposes a development and evaluation bottleneck in multilingual processing. We introduce JW300, a parallel corpus of over 300 languages with around 100 thousand parallel sentences per language pair on average. In this paper, we present the resource and showcase its utility in experiments with cross-lingual word embedding induction and multi-source part-of-speech projection},

 abstract = {One goal of linguistic phonetics is to determine why some sounds, but not others, are common in the languages of the world. In the sound system of any one language we typically find a number of common sounds plus a number of rare sounds. Considerations of such rare sounds have often focused on their historical origins. Less often discussed has been synchronic variation between common and uncommon sounds within and across closely related dialects or languages. In this paper I will describe the occurrence of certain unusual consonant types as dialectal variants in Isoko, an Edoid language spoken in parts of the delta area of Nigeria. When a number of dialects are considered a variety of double articulation types, air stream mechanisms, and phonation types will be seen to occur in Isoko. Most of these unusual variants alternate freely with other sounds within a dialect, and show regular correspondences across dialects. Such variations are of interest for the study of Edoid in general, and Isoko in particular, of course; but it is also relevant to the more general question of the occurrence of marked segment types. While this paper will not present historical data on the development of the unusual segment types, its synchronic documentation should prove useful to others in that respect.},
